        <div class="subheading mb-5">Digital MarketerðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a marketing professional that specializes in marketing channels and brands in the digital realm. I started learning about marketing when I was in middle school. That was around the time I obtained my first phone. There I began learning all about the web and just how important it is. In 7th grade I ran a youtube channel and harnessed a following online at the age of 11-12. Despite being so young, I was able to build up an audience and that is due to digital marketing. As I continued to learn more about digital marketing online I began creating multiple channels and started promoting them. I realized that I may have a talent for digital marketing and I decided to further my understanding of it. I went through many tutorials and guides that taught about digital marketing. It took many hours but as I kept learning I kept getting better and I saw great leaps of improvement.<br><br>

        
 As I kept managing the channels I had, I continued to treat them as a brand and market them. As more results came in I wanted to get an official job. Some years later I got a job with the city. In the city I did digital newsletters where I had to design its format for marketing and promotional potential. This greatly added to my experience as I had to meet hard deadlines and follow direct instructions from my supervisors. If I made big errors in the design it could prevent me from keeping my position in the future. It put some pressure on me but this helped me make progress and improve myself. Through that I gained a great deal of experience. I then began to market myself online, and brands started reaching out to me. As more and more brands reached out they would offer a sum of money if I successfully promoted their product.
<br><br>

        There were many times that a brand would reach out to me, and inquire for me to promote their product, and then I would send them the finished promoting formatting and transcript only for them to turn me down. This helped me learn that failure is not an option in digital marketing. Brands invest money to the digital marketer in hopes that they will successfully promote their channel and brand and make a greater sum of money than spent. If their marketing fails then their investment goes negative, and that isnâ€™t a great look. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to impress them with your premise and successfully produce results. If you do the digital marketing half-heartedly, it may fail and that could be a promising bridge burned. Sometimes you may think your idea is great and they may not approve of it. If you canâ€™t convince them then you need to go with a safer method first that works (to gain their trust). Once they trust you, they may allow more room for creative ideas from you. Overall this is a direct summary of experiences and lessons I learned in the world of digital marketing.
